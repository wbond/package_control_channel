<!--
Your pull request will be reviewed automatically and by a human.

Please ensure the automated reviews pass. Follow the instructions provided, if necessary.
You can speed up the process by [running some tests locally](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/submitting_a_package#Step_7).

In general, make sure you:

 1. Used `"tags": true` and not `"branch": "master"` 
    ([versioning docs](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/submitting_a_package#Step_4))
 2. Added a readme to your repository so that users (and reviewers) 
    can understand what your package provides.
 
You may proceed with a short description of what the package does and, 
in case a similar package already exists, 
why you believe it is needed
below this line. -->
